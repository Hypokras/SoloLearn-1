# SoloLearn
Selected from my codes on sololearn.com

I joined SoloLearn in August 2016 and I picked up Python course there. During my stay-in with this community, I managed to finish all their courses (still focusing on Python) and achieve the Platinum status in early 2017. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to become an every-day user and achieved a moderator status. Currently I aim to maintain my rank which is somewhere among the top users (#7 at best, but changes everyday ;)

Some of my codes are still public there, but I decided to store them on an external repo, too. They are *really* basic, I just store them here out of sentiment :D
